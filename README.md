### Beginners_Trading_Bot


Creating a trading bot - Python coding practice

We intend on coding 4 or 5 price action reversal patterns into our trading bot.

We also intend on using moving average crossovers as an additional buy/sell indicator

We also intend to use other indicators including bollinger bands, 

We intend to incorporate a range of strategies, including trend-following, mean reversion, and breakout strategies, 
We intend to employ machine learning techniques to continuously learn from past trading data and refine its decision-making process.

Our chart trading bot will be able to trade any instrument thats has a chart.
